We modeled a lahar flow's dynamics. To help with navigation's sake, we wish to guide you through how we have done this.
The code entitled "PrimaryMatlabCode.m" gives the video link showing our figures, and the link to our paper. 
The code underneath is the .m file for the code for our figures. The "AnimationCode.m" code, located as another code, shows the animated figure derived from such code. 
MatLabLive version of this, including some explanations for such derivations, are found in the "LiveFile.mlx" file which is available for download.
